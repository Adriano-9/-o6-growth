# Create Upsell Page Task

## Task Overview

```yaml
task_name: create-upsell-page
version: 2.0
category: funnel_optimization
tier_0_required: false
minimum_output: 4 deliverables
estimated_time: 1-3 hours
```

## Purpose

Create high-converting upsell, downsell, and order bump copy that maximizes customer lifetime value through strategic post-purchase offers. Based on methodologies from Alex Hormozi, Dan Kennedy, and proven funnel optimization frameworks.

Upselling is NOT about manipulation - it's about offering GENUINE value that helps customers achieve their goals faster, better, or more completely.

## THE ECONOMICS OF UPSELLING

### Why Upsells Matter

```yaml
key_statistics:
  returning_customers: "Spend 67% more than new customers"
  aov_increase: "Upsells increase AOV by 20-40%"
  acquisition_cost: "New customer acquisition costs 5-25x retention"
  existing_customer_probability: "60-70% chance of sale"
  new_prospect_probability: "5-20% chance of sale"
```

### The Funnel Math

```
Without Upsells:
100 customers × $100 = $10,000 revenue

With 25% Upsell Take Rate:
100 customers × $100 = $10,000
+ 25 upsells × $50 = $1,250
+ 10 order bumps × $20 = $200
= $11,450 revenue (14.5% increase)

With Optimized Funnel:
Can increase AOV by 40%+ without additional traffic
```

## THE HORMOZI MONEY MODEL

### Four Core Offer Types in Sequence

From Alex Hormozi's $100M framework:

```yaml
offer_sequence:
  1_attraction:
    purpose: "Generate initial conversion"
    pricing: "Low-ticket or free"
    goal: "Customer acquisition"

  2_upsell:
    purpose: "Increase immediate transaction value"
    pricing: "30-100% of main product"
    goal: "Maximize profit per customer"

  3_downsell:
    purpose: "Recover declined upsells"
    pricing: "50-70% less than upsell"
    goal: "Salvage additional revenue"

  4_continuity:
    purpose: "Recurring revenue"
    pricing: "Subscription/membership"
    goal: "Lifetime value maximization"
```

### The Value Equation for Upsells

```
Upsell Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood)
               ÷ (Time Delay × Effort Required)
```

**Application to Upsell Copy:**

| Variable | How to Maximize in Copy |
|----------|------------------------|
| Dream Outcome | Show how upsell AMPLIFIES main purchase result |
| Likelihood | Connect to purchase they just made (they already believe) |
| Time Delay | Emphasize FASTER results with the upsell |
| Effort | Position as "done-for-you" or "plug-and-play" |

### The $100M Principle

> "A good money model must cover acquisition and service costs within the first 30 days."

**Implication:** Structure upsells so profit from one customer funds acquisition of many.

## THREE UPSELL STRATEGIES

### Strategy 1: Quantity Upsells (More of the Same)

```yaml
concept: "Offer additional units at a discount"

when_to_use:
  - Consumable products
  - Products with repeat purchase cycle
  - Items where "more is better"

discount_sweet_spot: "25% off additional units"

copy_framework: |
  "You just ordered [Product].

  Want to stock up and save?

  Get [X] more for just $[Price] each - that's [%] off!

  Most customers grab at least 2 extras because [reason - it's
  a consumable / they want backups / the discount is too good]."

example:
  main: "30-day supplement supply - $49"
  upsell: "90-day supply - $99 (save 33%)"
```

### Strategy 2: Complementary Products (Completion)

```yaml
concept: "Offer items that pair naturally with purchase"

when_to_use:
  - Products with obvious accessories
  - Services with logical add-ons
  - Courses with implementation tools

psychology: "People have an innate desire to complete the set"

copy_framework: |
  "Great choice on [Main Product]!

  Here's something that makes it even better...

  Most customers also grab [Complementary Product] because
  it helps them [specific benefit].

  Add it to your order for just $[Price]?"

example:
  main: "Podcasting course"
  upsell: "Professional microphone bundle + editing templates"
```

### Strategy 3: Goal-Acceleration (Transformation)

```yaml
concept: "Offer products that speed up results"

when_to_use:
  - Courses or training programs
  - Health and fitness products
  - Business/productivity tools

copy_framework: |
  "You're on your way to [Goal] with [Main Product].

  But here's the thing...

  While the course gives you everything you need, most people
  find that [obstacle/challenge].

  That's why I created [Acceleration Product].

  It gives you:
  - [Speed benefit 1]
  - [Speed benefit 2]
  - [Speed benefit 3]

  The result? You get to [goal] in [timeframe] instead of [longer timeframe].

  Add it now for $[Price]."

example:
  main: "Weight loss program - $97"
  upsell: "Meal prep service + accountability coach - $197"
```

## VALUE STACK FRAMEWORK

### The Kennedy Value Stacking Method

Present each component with its own standalone value to make the total price feel insignificant.

```yaml
value_stack_structure:
  component_1:
    name: "[Main deliverable]"
    value: "$XXX"
    why_it_matters: "This alone is worth the price because [specific reason]"

  component_2:
    name: "[Supporting deliverable]"
    value: "$XXX"
    why_it_matters: "Saves you [time/money] by [how]"

  component_3:
    name: "[Implementation tool]"
    value: "$XXX"
    why_it_matters: "Makes implementation [faster/easier] because [how]"

  bonus:
    name: "[Unexpected extra]"
    value: "$XXX"
    why_it_matters: "Included FREE to [reason]"

  total_value: "[Sum of all components]"
  your_price: "[Actual price - should be 20-30% of total value]"
```

## DOWNSELL PAGE FRAMEWORK

### Downsell Philosophy

The downsell is NOT just a cheaper version - it's a different solution for a price-sensitive segment.

### Three Downsell Approaches

```yaml
approach_1_component_extraction:
  concept: "Offer just one part of the full upsell"
  example:
    upsell: "Complete Coaching Package - $497"
    downsell: "Just the Templates - $97"

approach_2_payment_plan:
  concept: "Same product, spread over payments"
  example:
    upsell: "$497 one-time"
    downsell: "3 payments of $197"

approach_3_alternative_product:
  concept: "Different solution at lower price point"
  example:
    upsell: "1-on-1 Coaching - $497"
    downsell: "Group Coaching - $197"
```

### Downsell Page Structure

```

## ORDER BUMP COPY FRAMEWORK

### Order Bump Anatomy

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ☐ YES! Add [Product Name] for just $[Price]              │
│                                                          │
│ [1-2 sentences explaining the benefit]                   │
│                                                          │
│ (Save [%] - Regular price: $[Higher Price])              │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Order Bump Examples by Industry

```yaml
digital_products:
  text: "☐ YES! Add the Implementation Worksheets for just $17"
  benefit: "Get the exact templates I use to implement everything taught in the course. Saves hours of setup time."
  savings: "(Save 65% - Regular price: $47)"

physical_products:
  text: "☐ YES! Add Express Shipping + Priority Handling for $9.95"

software:
  text: "☐ YES! Add Done-For-You Setup for $29"
  benefit: "Our team configures everything so you can start using the software immediately."
  savings: "(Save 2+ hours of setup time)"
```

### Order Bump Best Practices

```yaml
rules:
  - keep_short: "2-3 lines maximum"
  - checkbox_psychology: "People like completing/checking things"
  - show_savings: "Compare to 'regular' price"
  - complement: "Must enhance, not distract from main purchase"
  - impulse_pricing: "$7-47 sweet spot"
  - single_focus: "One obvious benefit"
```

---

## PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS

### Trigger 1: Commitment and Consistency

```yaml
principle: "People who make a purchase are psychologically committed and more likely to say yes to related offers"

application:
  - Acknowledge their smart decision
  - Position upsell as natural next step
  - Connect upsell to the commitment they just made
```

### Trigger 2: The Decoy Effect

```yaml
principle: "Presenting three options where one appears most valuable"

application: |
  Option A: Basic - $49
  Option B: Pro - $99 (TARGET - Best Value)
  Option C: Premium - $199

  Premium makes Pro look reasonable.
  Basic makes Pro look comprehensive.
```

### Trigger 3: Social Proof

```yaml
principle: "People follow the actions of others"

application:
  - "73% of customers who bought [Main] also added [Upsell]"
  - "Best-seller" badges
  - Testimonials specific to the upsell
  - Real-time: "John just added this to his order"
```

### Trigger 4: Scarcity

```yaml
principle: "Limited availability increases perceived value"

legitimate_scarcity:
  - One-time offer (page expires)
  - Limited quantity ("Only 7 spots left")
  - Time-limited discount
  - Exclusive to this purchase

warning: "Scarcity must be REAL. Fake scarcity destroys trust."
```

### Trigger 5: Reciprocity

```yaml
principle: "Giving something triggers desire to give back"

application:
  - Position discount as a gift for buying main product
  - "As a thank you for your purchase..."
  - Include unexpected bonus in the offer
```
