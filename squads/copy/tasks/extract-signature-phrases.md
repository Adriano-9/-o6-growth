## Objective

Extract and curate 42+ memorable, quotable phrases from a copywriter's body of work, organized into a 7-tier system based on usage frequency and context. These phrases become the "voice bank" that makes the AI agent sound authentically like the original copywriter.

**Key Principle:** A signature phrase must be able to stand alone, be memorable, and feel distinctly like the copywriter said it—not a generic statement anyone could make.

**Research Foundation:** This task is based on stylometric analysis research achieving up to 91% accuracy in author identification through linguistic features. The methodology combines:
1. Forensic linguistics for idiolect identification
2. Brand voice documentation standards
3. AI voice cloning best practices
4. Quantitative frequency analysis

## THE SCIENCE OF SIGNATURE PHRASES

### What Are Signature Phrases?

Signature phrases are distinctive linguistic patterns that uniquely identify a communicator. They function as a "linguistic fingerprint" - a combination of:

1. **Catchphrases** - Repeated memorable expressions
2. **Mantras** - Core philosophical statements
3. **Tactical terminology** - Domain-specific language
4. **Rhetorical patterns** - Distinctive persuasion techniques
5. **Verbal tics** - Unconscious speech patterns

**Key Research Finding:**
> "Register variation explains stylometric authorship analysis... people have unique styles of writing. Given sufficient data, it is generally possible to distinguish between the writings of a small group of authors through the multivariate analysis of the relative frequencies of common function words." (Grieve, 2023)

### The Linguistic Fingerprint Formula

Based on NLP research for behavioral science:

```
LINGUISTIC FINGERPRINT =
  Vocabulary Signature (30%)
  + Syntactic Patterns (25%)
  + Discourse Markers (20%)
  + Rhetorical Devices (15%)
  + Prosodic Patterns (10%)
```

### Idiolect Marker Accuracy Rates

| Marker Category | Description | Accuracy Rate |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| Vocabulary patterns | Word choice, frequency, uniqueness | 85-91% |
| Syntactic structures | Sentence construction patterns | 78-85% |
| Prosodic features | Rhythm, emphasis, pacing | 75-82% |
| Discourse markers | Transition words, fillers | 70-78% |
| Semantic preferences | Topic clustering, metaphor usage | 72-80% |

**Critical Finding:** Digital communication settings achieve up to 91% accuracy using linguistic features alone.

### Why Custom Instructions Fail

Simply writing "be conversational" or "sound like [person]" produces generic output. Authentic voice replication requires:
1. Specific phrase examples with exact wording
2. Context for when and how to use each phrase
3. Frequency guidelines for natural distribution
4. Prohibited alternatives to avoid generic substitutions

## PHASE 1: RECONNAISSANCE

### Step 1.1: Inventory Source Materials

Create a comprehensive inventory of all available source materials:

| File | Type | Word Count | Phrase Potential | Notes |
|------|------|------------|------------------|-------|
| [filename] | Article/Transcript/Interview | [count] | High/Medium/Low | [Notable quotes observed] |

**Source Inventory Template:**
```markdown
## Source Material Inventory

### High Priority Sources (Process First)
1. [filename] - [type] - [word count] - [notable observations]

### Medium Priority Sources
1. [filename] - [type] - [word count] - [notable observations]

### Low Priority Sources (Process Last)
1. [filename] - [type] - [word count] - [notable observations]

Total Sources: [N]
Estimated Total Words: [N]
```

### Step 1.2: Read Reference Agent

Study the signature_phrases section in `agents/dan-kennedy.md`:

**Analysis Points:**
1. Observe the tier structure and naming
2. Note phrase length patterns (average 5-15 words)

- [ ] Three main themes identified for Tiers 3-5
- [ ] Tier names customized to copywriter's domains
- [ ] Source priority order established

---

## PHASE 2: PHRASE IDENTIFICATION

### Step 2.1: Signature Phrase Criteria

**A signature phrase MUST be:**

| Criterion | Definition | Test Question |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Standalone | Makes sense without context | "Can I understand this phrase alone?" |
| Memorable | Sticks in your mind | "Would I remember this tomorrow?" |
| Original | Distinctly theirs, not generic | "Could anyone say this, or just them?" |
| Quotable | Something you'd cite or share | "Would I post this as a quote?" |
| Repeatable | Appears multiple times OR too good to ignore | "Have I seen this elsewhere?" |

**A signature phrase must NOT be:**

| Disqualifier | Example | Why Rejected |
|--------------|---------|--------------|
| Generic advice | "Work hard and succeed" | Anyone could say this |
| Incomplete thought | "And that's why..." | Requires context |
| Overly technical | "The CTR optimization protocol" | No punch, no personality |
| Factual statement | "Email open rates average 20%" | No personality |
| Too long | 30+ word statement | Not quotable |
| Common cliché | "Time is money" | Not original |

### Step 2.2: The Attribution Test

**The Ultimate Uniqueness Test:**

> Remove the speaker's name - would you still know who said it?

- **YES** → Strong signature phrase candidate
- **MAYBE** → Secondary candidate, needs context
- **NO** → Generic statement, REJECT

**Attribution Test Examples:**

| Phrase | Attribution Test | Result |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| "Money is attracted to speed." | Recognizable as Kennedy | ✅ PASS |
| "Work hard every day." | Could be anyone | ❌ FAIL |
| "The fortune is in the follow-up." | Recognizable as Kennedy | ✅ PASS |
| "Marketing is important." | Generic | ❌ FAIL |

### Step 2.3: Extraction Process

For each source file, extract candidate phrases:

**Extraction Template:**
```markdown
## [Source File Name]

### File Metadata
- Type: [Article/Transcript/Interview]
- Word Count: [N]
- Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]

### Candidate Phrases

| # | Phrase | Tier Candidate | Quotability Score | Notes |
|---|--------|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| 1 | "Exact quote from source" | 1-7 | 1-10 | [Context/usage notes] |
| 2 | "Another phrase" | 1-7 | 1-10 | [Notes] |
```

**Extraction Rules:**
1. Copy phrases EXACTLY as written (preserve voice)
2. Note the context where it appears
3. Tag with candidate tier (can change later)
4. Apply quotability score (see Step 2.5)
5. Err on side of over-extraction (filter later)

### Step 2.4: Frequency Analysis

Cross-reference phrases across all sources:

**Frequency Tracking Template:**
```markdown
## Frequency Analysis

| Phrase | S1 | S2 | S3 | S4 | S5 | Total | Tier |
|--------|----|----|----|----|----| ------|------|
| "[phrase]" | ✓ | ✓ | - | ✓ | - | 3 | 2 |
| "[phrase]" | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 5 | 1 |
```

**Frequency-to-Tier Mapping:**
```
5+ occurrences  → Tier 1 candidate (Core Mantra)
3-4 occurrences → Tier 2-3 candidate (Methodology/Theme)
2 occurrences   → Tier 4-6 candidate (based on quality)
1 occurrence    → Tier 7 only (if exceptionally quotable)
```

### Step 2.5: Quotability Assessment

Score each candidate phrase:

**Quotability Scoring Rubric:**

| Factor | 1 Point | 2 Points |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Brevity | 16-25 words | Under 15 words |
| Rhythm | Adequate flow | Natural, memorable cadence |
| Imagery | Abstract concept | Vivid mental picture |
| Surprise | Expected phrasing | Unexpected word choice |
| Truth | Reasonable insight | Profound, resonant wisdom |

**Scoring Template:**
```
Phrase: "[candidate phrase]"

Brevity (1-2):  ___
Rhythm (1-2):   ___
Imagery (1-2):  ___
Surprise (1-2): ___
Truth (1-2):    ___

TOTAL: ___ / 10

TIER RECOMMENDATION:
- 8-10 = Tier 1-2 candidate
- 6-7  = Tier 3-5 candidate
- 4-5  = Tier 6-7 candidate
- <4   = REJECT
```

### Step 2.6: Contrast Analysis

Compare phrases against baseline to ensure distinctiveness:

**Distinctiveness Score Formula:**
```
Distinctiveness = (Target Usage - Baseline Usage) / Baseline Variance

Score > 2.0  = Highly distinctive (signature phrase candidate)
Score 1.0-2.0 = Moderately distinctive (secondary candidate)
Score < 1.0  = Generic (REJECT)
```

**Contrast Questions:**
1. Do competitors say this? (If yes, -2 points)
2. Is this in generic marketing advice? (If yes, -2 points)
3. Would a student immediately attribute this? (If yes, +2 points)
4. Does this use their distinctive vocabulary? (If yes, +2 points)

## PHASE 4: DOCUMENTATION

### Step 4.1: The 4-Field Documentation Standard

For each selected phrase, document with exactly 4 fields:

```yaml
- phrase: "The exact phrase in original language"
  context: "When, why, and how to use this phrase - specific guidance (15+ words)"
  usage: "Specific trigger situation (5-15 words)"
  source: "Source file or 'Multiple sources' for high-frequency"
```

### Step 4.2: Context Field Guidelines

The `context` field is CRITICAL for proper phrase usage.

**Context MUST Answer:**
1. **WHEN** to use this phrase (trigger situation)
2. **WHY** this phrase works (persuasion mechanism)
3. **HOW** to integrate (copy type, placement)

**Good Context Examples:**

```yaml
# GOOD - Specific and actionable
context: "Use when explaining why short-term thinking fails. Works well in sales pages when addressing instant gratification objections. Particularly effective after describing the 'easy way' that doesn't work."

context: "Deploy when prospect expresses price hesitation. Reframes the investment as speed-to-results. Most powerful in high-ticket sales conversations or webinar closes."

context: "Use to open sales letters or emails when audience has been burned before. Establishes credibility by acknowledging their skepticism. Works with Unaware and Problem-Aware audiences."
```

**Bad Context Examples:**

```yaml
# BAD - Too vague
context: "Business advice"
context: "Use in marketing"
context: "For sales"
context: "When relevant"
```

**Context Word Count:**
- Minimum: 15 words
- Ideal: 25-40 words
- Maximum: 60 words

### Step 4.3: Source Attribution Standards

**Source Field Formats:**

1. **Single Source:**
   ```yaml
   source: "The Ultimate Sales Letter, Chapter 7"
   ```

2. **Multiple Sources (High Frequency):**
   ```yaml
   source: "Multiple sources: No B.S. Direct Marketing, GKIC seminars, interviews"
   ```

3. **Specific Reference:**
   ```yaml
   source: "Interview with Joe Polish, 2019"
   ```

### Step 4.4: Complete Tier Documentation

**Tier Documentation Template:**

```yaml
tier_N_[tier_name]:
  frequency: "[use_every_piece|weekly|per_topic_context|monthly|as_needed]"
  description: "[What this tier represents - 10-20 words]"
  phrases:
    - phrase: "[Exact phrase]"
      context: "[15-40 words describing when/why/how]"
      usage: "[5-15 word trigger]"
      source: "[Source attribution]"
```

### Step 4.5: Compile Final Document

## PHASE 6: AI INTEGRATION

### Step 6.1: Phrase Usage Frequency

Optimal usage frequencies for AI agents:

| Tier | Frequency | AI Implementation |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| Tier 1 | Every piece | Include 1-2 in any output |
| Tier 2 | Weekly | Include when discussing methodology |
| Tier 3-5 | Per topic | Include when topic is relevant |
| Tier 6 | Monthly | Include for depth/philosophy |
| Tier 7 | As needed | Include for specific situations |

### Step 6.2: Context-Aware Selection Algorithm

**Selection Process for AI Agent:**
```
1. Identify output context (sales page, email, social post)
2. Determine primary topic
3. Check for situational triggers
4. Select phrases from appropriate tiers:
   - Always: 1 from Tier 1
   - If methodology discussed: 1 from Tier 2
   - If topic X: 1-2 from relevant Tier 3-5
   - If philosophical content: 1 from Tier 6
   - If specific situation: 1 from Tier 7
5. Verify no conflicts between selected phrases
6. Integrate naturally into output
```

### Step 6.3: The 3-Layer Voice Model

**Voice Layer Structure:**
1. **Foundation Layer** - Tier 1 mantras (always present)
2. **Contextual Layer** - Tier 2-5 phrases (topic-dependent)
3. **Situational Layer** - Tier 6-7 phrases (occasion-dependent)

**Layer Integration Rules:**
- Foundation layer establishes voice identity
- Contextual layer adds relevant expertise
- Situational layer provides specific guidance
