# Create Order Bump Task
## Copy Framework v2.0 - Comprehensive Order Bump Creation System

**Task Version:** 2.0
**Primary Frameworks:** Three Psychological Triggers + Value Stacking + Impulse Purchase Psychology
**Research Source:** docs/research/order-bump-methodology-research.md

---

## Purpose

Create high-converting order bump offers that leverage the buyer's existing commitment momentum to increase Average Order Value (AOV) by 10-30%. Order bumps are the lowest-friction revenue multiplier in any funnel.

**Core Insight:** Order bumps are "the sneakiest, friendliest little sales ninja in your funnel" - a tiny checkbox that capitalizes on the buyer's "yes" mindset to add complementary value.

**Golden Rule:** An order bump should make the customer's life easier, faster, or better - NOT trick them into buying something they don't need.

---

## When to Use

- Checkout/payment page (primary use case)
- Shopping cart before payment
- Any pre-purchase decision point
- Subscription signup pages
- Event registration checkouts

**Critical Context:** Order bumps appear ON the checkout page with a simple checkbox - not after purchase (that's upselling) or during browsing (that's cross-selling).

---

### 1.2 Type Selection Decision Tree

```
Q1: What does the customer need MOST after buying?

→ To implement faster?
  → Type A: Accelerator

→ Something that makes the main better?
  → Type B: Complement

→ A "better" version of what they're getting?
  → Type C: Upgrade

→ A practical tool to apply it?
  → Type D: Tool

→ Help if they get stuck?
  → Type E: Support

→ To go deeper on the topic?
  → Type F: Bonus
```

### 1.3 Type Selection Output

```yaml
bump_type_selection:
  selected_type: "[A-F]"
  rationale: "[Why this type]"
  expected_take_rate: "[X-Y%]"
  copy_angle: "[Primary angle]"
```

---

## Step 2: Pricing Strategy

### 2.1 The Golden Rule: 10-25% of Main Product

**Price Mapping:**

| Main Product Price | Bump Range | Sweet Spot |
|-------------------|------------|------------|
| $27-$47 | $5-$12 | $7 |
| $97-$147 | $17-$37 | $27 |
| $197-$297 | $27-$67 | $47 |
| $497-$697 | $47-$127 | $97 |
| $997-$1,497 | $97-$247 | $147 |
| $1,997+ | $197-$397 | $297 |

### 2.2 Price Psychology Techniques

#### Technique 1: Original Value Anchor
```markdown
"Usually $197 — yours for just $47 today"
Savings: 76% OFF

"Normally $97 → Checkout price: $27"
You save: $70
```

#### Technique 2: Daily Cost Breakdown
```markdown
"Just $27 — that's less than $1 per day for a month"
"$47 = price of a few coffees"
"$97 = what you'd spend on [comparable waste]"
```

#### Technique 3: Per-Use Value
```markdown
"$47 for unlimited use = pennies per [use case]"
"Use these 20 templates forever — that's $2.35 each"
```

#### Technique 4: Comparison Anchor
```markdown
"The same templates agencies charge $500 to create"
"What would cost $2,000 to build yourself"
"Comparable tools sell for $99/month"
```

### 2.3 Price Testing Framework

**Test Order:**
1. Sweet spot price (from table)
2. -$10 from sweet spot
3. +$10 from sweet spot
4. Different anchoring approach

**Decision Matrix:**
- If take rate < 15%: Test lower price
- If take rate 20-40%: Optimize copy, keep price
- If take rate > 45%: Test higher price

### 2.4 Pricing Output

```yaml
pricing_strategy:
  main_product_price: "$X"
  bump_price: "$Y"
  ratio: "X%"
  anchor_price: "$Z (original value)"
  savings_display: "[How to show savings]"
```

## Step 3: The Three Psychological Triggers

### 3.1 Trigger 1: The "No-Brainer" Effect

**Principle:** Make the bump so obviously valuable it requires zero deliberation.

**How to Apply:**

✅ **Make it stupidly obvious:**
```markdown
Main: Course on [Topic]
Bump: Templates to implement [Topic]

"You just bought [how to do X].
Here's everything you need to actually do it."
```

✅ **Direct complement:**
- Bump should feel like a natural pairing
- Customer shouldn't need to think "why would I need this?"
- Should feel like "of course I want that"

✅ **Low price point:**
- Keep within 10-25% rule
- Impulse-friendly
- No analysis paralysis

**Copy Test:** If a customer has to think more than 3 seconds, simplify.

### 3.2 Trigger 2: Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)

**Principle:** Leverage urgency and exclusivity.

**Key Insight:** "Once someone says yes, it gets easier to say yes again."

**FOMO Application Methods:**

#### Method A: Checkout-Only Pricing
```markdown
"This price is ONLY available at checkout"
"Once you leave, this offer disappears"
"You won't see this price again"
```

#### Method B: Price Escalation
```markdown
"Usually $97 — checkout price: $27"
"After checkout, returns to full price"
```

#### Method C: Exclusive Access
```markdown
"Only available when buying [Main Product]"
"Not sold anywhere else"
"Exclusive bundle offer"
```

#### Method D: Social Proof FOMO
```markdown
"87% of customers add this"
"Most popular add-on"
"Join [X] others who grabbed this"
```

**Important:** Create perceived scarcity WITHOUT being manipulative.

### 3.3 Trigger 3: Tiny Yes Momentum

**Principle:** Capitalize on already-committed mental state.

**Context:** Customer is already:
- Wallet out
- In "yes" mindset
- Past major decision
- Looking to complete purchase

**Application:**

✅ **Frame as natural progression:**
```markdown
"Since you're already getting [Main], add [Bump] for just $X"
"Complete your purchase with [Bump]"
"While you're here, grab [Bump]"
```

✅ **Minimize new decisions:**
- One simple checkbox
- Clear yes/no choice
- No extra deliberation required

✅ **Connect to existing purchase:**
```markdown
"The perfect companion to what you just chose"
"Makes your [Main Product] even more powerful"
```

### 3.4 Trigger Integration

**Best Practice:** Combine all three triggers:

```markdown
☐ YES! Add the [Bump] for just $47

### Get Results 2x Faster [No-Brainer]

[Main Product] teaches the method.
[Bump] gives you the shortcuts.

✓ 20 done-for-you templates [No-Brainer]
✓ Used by 85% of our customers [FOMO]
✓ Perfect with what you're buying [Momentum]

~~$197~~ → Just $47 (checkout only) [FOMO]

⚠️ This offer disappears after checkout [FOMO]
```

## Step 5: Visual Design Guidelines

### 5.1 Placement

**Page Flow:**

     ↓
═══════════════════════════════
[   ORDER BUMP BOX          ]
═══════════════════════════════
     ↓
[Payment Information]
     ↓
[Complete Purchase Button]
```

### 5.2 Container Design

**DO:**
- Subtle colored border (matches brand)
- Light background tint
- Clear visual separation from order summary
- Looks "special" without being spammy

**DON'T:**
- Aggressive flashing or animation
- Clashing colors
- Looks like an ad/banner
- Blends too much (invisible)

**Example Styling:**
```css
.order-bump {
  border: 2px solid [brand-accent];
  background: [brand-light-tint];
  padding: 20px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  margin: 20px 0;
}
```

### 5.3 Checkbox Design

**Size:** Large enough for easy clicking (minimum 20px x 20px)

**States:**
- Unchecked: Clear empty box
- Checked: Filled with checkmark + slight color
- Hover: Subtle highlight

**Mobile:** Thumb-friendly size (44px x 44px touch target)

### 5.4 Typography

**Checkbox Label:** Bold, clear, prominent
**Headline:** Slightly larger than body, bold
**Description:** Regular weight, readable
**Bullets:** Clear checkmarks, scannable
**Price:** Bold, color for current price

### 5.5 Optional Product Image

**When to Include:**
- Physical products (show what they get)
- Digital bundles (mockup of deliverables)

### Relevance Mistakes

❌ Bump competes with main product
❌ Requires explanation to understand fit

### Pricing Mistakes

❌ No anchor price (misses psychology)

### Copy Mistakes
❌ Too much text (not scannable)
❌ Feature-focused, not benefit-focused
❌ Generic headlines ("Special Offer!")
❌ No urgency element

### Design Mistakes
❌ Hidden or tiny checkbox
❌ Looks spammy/aggressive
❌ Poor mobile experience
❌ Pre-checked by default (unethical)

### Ethical Mistakes
