# Create Downsell Page Task
## Copy Framework v2.0 - Comprehensive Downsell Creation System

**Task Version:** 2.0
**Primary Frameworks:** Loss Aversion Psychology + Acknowledgment Framework + Dan Kennedy Direct Response
**Research Source:** docs/research/downsell-methodology-research.md

---

## Purpose

Create psychologically optimized downsell pages that recover lost sales by offering strategic alternatives to customers who declined the main offer. This task leverages the 5 Hesitation Drivers, Loss Aversion Principle, and proven copy frameworks to transform "no" into revenue.

**Core Insight:** DigitalMarketer converted 15% of abandoning visitors with strategic downselling. Your downsell is the last opportunity in the sales funnel to close a deal.

---

## When to Use

- After customer declines main offer or upsell
- Exit intent detected on sales/checkout pages
- Cart abandonment recovery
- Post-rejection in one-click upsell funnels
- When price is the primary objection
- To provide budget-friendly entry point

**Critical Timing:** Downsell appears AFTER rejection, BEFORE thank you page. This window is when buying momentum remains but price barrier blocked conversion.

---

## Step 1: Objection Diagnosis

Before writing copy, identify the PRIMARY objection that caused rejection.

### The 5 Hesitation Drivers

#### Driver 1: Price Objection
**Signals:**
- Fast rejection after seeing price
- Hovering over price then leaving
- Abandonment at checkout/payment step
- "Can't afford it right now" feedback

**Downsell Response:**
- Lite version with core value
- Extended payment plan
- Entry-level alternative
- Trial period

**Copy Approach:**
```markdown
"I understand. $[price] is a real investment.
That's why I created [Downsell] for just $[lower_price].
Same [core benefit], budget-friendly package."
```

#### Driver 2: Timing Objection
**Signals:**
- "Not the right time"
- "Maybe later"
- Engaged with content but didn't buy
- Longer time on page before leaving

**Downsell Response:**
- Quick-start mini product
- Trial/sample access
- "Start now, complete later" option
- Time-limited special

**Copy Approach:**
```markdown
"Maybe the full [Product] isn't right today.
But what about just [core piece] to get started?
Quick win now, upgrade when ready."
```

#### Driver 3: Trust Objection
**Signals:**
- Reading testimonials/reviews extensively
- Checking credentials
- "Is this legit?" type behavior
- Cold traffic with no prior relationship

**Downsell Response:**
- Trial period
- Lower-risk entry point
- Money-back guarantee emphasis
- Proof-of-concept purchase

**Copy Approach:**
```markdown
"Don't trust it yet? I get it.
Try [Downsell] for just $[low_price].
If it doesn't blow your mind, full refund.
Zero risk to test drive."
```

#### Driver 4: Overwhelm Objection
**Signals:**
- Scanning but not reading
- Multiple page visits without action
- "Seems like a lot" feedback
- Feature overload signals

**Downsell Response:**
- Simplified version
- Core-only offering
- "Just the essentials"
- One specific outcome focus

**Copy Approach:**
```markdown
"[Product] has everything. Maybe too much?
[Downsell] is laser-focused on [one outcome].
No extras. No overwhelm. Just results."
```

#### Driver 5: Commitment Objection
**Signals:**
- Balking at subscription/recurring
- "What if I don't use it?"
- Long-term commitment hesitation
- Cancellation policy queries

**Downsell Response:**
- One-time payment option
- Lifetime access offer
- No recurring version
- Single use/project option

**Copy Approach:**
```markdown
"No commitment required.
[Downsell] is one payment, yours forever.
Use it whenever you want. No subscriptions."
```

### Diagnosis Output Template

    savings_highlight: "Save $Z / X% off"
    value_framing: "[How to present value vs price]"
```

---

## Step 3: Psychology Integration

### 3.1 Loss Aversion Framework

**Principle:** Losses feel 2x more painful than equivalent gains feel good.

**Application in Copy:**

```markdown
BEFORE YOU LEAVE...

You're about to walk away from:
• [Benefit 1] - GONE
• [Benefit 2] - GONE
• [Outcome 3] - GONE

But it doesn't have to be all or nothing.

[Downsell] gives you [core benefit]
for a fraction of the investment.

Don't leave empty-handed.
```

**Loss Aversion CTAs:**
- "Don't leave with nothing"
- "At least take THIS with you"
- "Don't miss out completely"
- "Something is better than nothing"

### 3.2 Foot-in-the-Door Technique

**Principle:** Small commitments lead to larger future commitments.

**Application:**

```markdown
START SMALL, GROW BIG

[Downsell] is your entry point.
Get results. Build confidence.
Upgrade when you're ready.

Many of our most successful customers
started exactly where you are now.
```

**Data Point:** Downsell customers who later upgrade often have HIGHER LTV than direct premium buyers.

### 3.3 Anchoring Effect

**Principle:** First price creates reference point for all subsequent prices.

**Application:**

```markdown
You just saw [Product] at $997.

That's the complete system.
Premium support. All bonuses. Everything.

But what if you could get the CORE
for just $197?

You save $800.
You still get [main transformation].

That's 80% off for 80% of the results.
```

### 3.4 Contrast Principle

**Principle:** Sequential presentation makes differences seem larger.

**Application:**

After seeing $997 (rejected), $197 feels like a steal even if objectively it's still significant money.

```markdown
QUICK MATH:

[Full Program]: $997
[Essentials]: $197

Difference: $800 in your pocket
Still included: [Core result]

Same outcome. 80% less investment.
No-brainer, right?
```

### 3.5 Dan Kennedy's No-Begging Principle

**Principle:** Present downsell as genuine alternative, never as desperation.

**Wrong Approach (Begging):**
```
"Please! At least buy something!
We'll take anything!
Don't leave us!"
```

**Right Approach (Confident):**
```
"[Main offer] isn't for everyone.
I created [Downsell] for exactly this situation.
Take it or leave it - your call.
But this page is your only chance."
```

for a fraction of the investment?**

✓ [Component 1] — [value]
✓ [Component 2] — [value]

**Dan Kennedy Style:**
- Confident, not desperate
- One offer, take it or leave it
- Clear urgency
- No apology for selling

**Full Template:**
```markdown
# Look, I Understand

[Main Offer] isn't for everyone.

Maybe not today.
Maybe not ever.

**That's fine.**

But before you go, I want you to know about [Downsell].

It's not the complete system.
It's the [core piece] that handles [specific problem].

**$[price]. One time.**

No upsells after this.
No tricks.
Just [product] for [price].

This is the only time you'll see this offer.
Take it or leave it.

[I'LL TAKE IT →]

[I'll leave it]
```

### 5.5 The Problem-Reminder Framework

**Structure:**
1. Remind them of the problem
2. Acknowledge main offer rejection
3. Offer simpler solution
4. Make it easy to say yes

**Full Template:**
```markdown
# [Problem] Is Still There

You came here because [describe pain point].

[Main Offer] wasn't right.
Got it.

**But [problem] doesn't care.**

It's still costing you [cost of problem].
Every day you wait is another day of [pain].

## Here's a Simpler Path:

[Downsell Name]
Just $[price]

It won't solve everything.
But it WILL solve [specific aspect].

And that's a start.

[START SOLVING [PROBLEM] FOR $[PRICE] →]

[No, I'll keep dealing with [problem]]
```

---

## Step 6: Urgency Elements

### 6.1 Urgency Types

#### Countdown Timer
```markdown
⏱️ This Offer Expires In: [15:00]

When the timer hits zero, this page redirects
and you'll never see this price again.
```

#### One-Time Offer Statement
```markdown
⚠️ ONE-TIME OFFER

This page appears once.
Close it and it's gone forever.
There's no link to come back.
```

#### Limited Quantity (If True)
```markdown
🔥 Only [X] Spots Remaining

[Y] people have claimed this today.
Once they're gone, price returns to $[higher].
```

#### Price Increase Warning
```markdown
💰 Special Exit Pricing

Regular price: $[higher]
This page only: $[lower]

After you leave: back to $[higher]
```

### 6.2 Urgency Copy Rules

**DO:**
- Use real urgency (actual timers, actual limits)
- Explain why it's urgent
- Be specific about consequence

**DON'T:**
- Fake scarcity (damages trust)
- Multiple urgency types (overwhelming)
- Vague threats ("limited time!")

---

## Step 7: CTA Optimization

### 7.1 Acceptance CTAs

**First-Person, Action-Oriented:**
```
✓ Yes! I Want [Product] for $[Price]!
✓ Give Me [Product] Now - $[Price]
✓ I'm In! Let's Do This for $[Price]
✓ Add [Product] to My Order - $[Price]
✓ Claim My [Product] for Just $[Price]
```

**Benefit-Focused:**
```
✓ Start [Achieving Result] for $[Price]
✓ Get [Core Benefit] Now - $[Price]
✓ Begin [Transformation] Today - $[Price]
```

### 7.2 Rejection CTAs (Loss Aversion)

**Problem Continuation:**
```
✗ No thanks, I'll keep struggling with [problem]
✗ No, I don't need help with [issue]
✗ I'll figure out [problem] on my own
```

**Loss Framing:**
```
✗ No, I'll pass on this opportunity
✗ No thanks, I'll leave empty-handed
✗ I'd rather miss out on [benefit]
```

**Neutral (Less Pressure):**
```
✗ Not right now, thank you
✗ Skip this offer
✗ Continue without [Product]
```

### 7.3 CTA Design Principles

- **Acceptance Button:** Prominent, contrasting color, above fold
- **Rejection Link:** Smaller text link below button
- **No Third Option:** Binary choice only (yes/no)

## Step 9: Metrics & Optimization

### 9.1 Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | Formula | Benchmark |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Downsell Conversion Rate** | Downsell sales ÷ Upsell rejections | 15-30% |
| **Revenue Recovery Rate** | Downsell revenue ÷ Lost upsell revenue | 20-40% |
| **Upgrade Rate** | Downsell buyers who upgrade ÷ Total downsell buyers | 10-25% |
| **Funnel Save Rate** | (Upsell + Downsell conversions) ÷ Main offer buyers | 40-60% |
| **Downsell LTV** | Average lifetime value of downsell customers | Should approach main offer LTV |

### 9.2 A/B Testing Priorities

**Test First (Highest Impact):**
1. **Price Point:** $7 vs $17 vs $27 vs $47
2. **Headline Approach:** Empathy vs urgency vs curiosity
3. **Offer Type:** Lite vs payment plan vs trial

**Test Second:**
4. CTA copy and button color
5. Urgency mechanism (timer vs statement)
6. Guarantee prominence

**Test Third:**
7. Page length (short vs detailed)
8. Image/mockup inclusion
9. Rejection link copy

### 9.3 Optimization Process

1. **Baseline:** Establish current conversion rate (need 100+ rejections for statistical validity)
2. **Hypothesis:** "Changing [X] will improve conversion by [Y]%"
3. **Test:** Single variable A/B test
4. **Analyze:** Wait for 95%+ statistical confidence
5. **Implement:** Roll out winner
6. **Iterate:** Move to next test
